# Ecommerce-Sales-Dashboard
Power BI dashboard analyzing sales trends from an e-commerce dataset
### Project Story
I built this E-commerce Sales Dashboard using Power BI to explore how data can review patterns behind everyday online transactions.
The dataset included:
'InvoiceNo', 'StockCode', 'Description', 'Quantity', 'InvoiceDate', 'UnitPrice', 'CustomerID', 'Country', and 'Revenue'.
My goal was to transform these fields into meaningful insights about customer behaviour, top performing products, and sales trends across different countries and time periods.


### Key Focus Areas
- Identifying **top-selling products** and their share of total revenue
- Tracking **monthly sales trends** and spotting seasonal peaks
- Analyzing **customer activity by country**
- Measuring **total and average revenue growth** over time


### Insights Discovered
- A few products accounted for a major portion of sales revenue
- The **United Kingdom** contributed the highest number of transactions
- Monthly revenue patterns revealed noticeable **seasonal fluctuations**
- Customer spending behaviour varied across regions

### Tools and Techniques
- **Power BI Desktop** - data modelling and visualization
- **Excel** - data cleaning and preparation
- **DAX Formulas** - for calculated coumns like 'Revenue = Quantity x UnitPrice'
- Visuals used: line charts, bar charts, slicers, KPI cards
